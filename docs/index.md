<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- But how?

    Thanks to [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/){target=_blank} - port of Python to [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/){target=_blank}, based on [WASM](https://webassembly.org/){target=_blank}.

- Why?)

    Use Python in browser to build modern frontend via BeePy!
